# PS-Module1Project
Overview:
This project is my first game built while enrolled in the Per Scholas Software Engineering course. Players will go against the computer to see who can score the most points in a game of darts.

Game Play:
There will be 5 rounds for the player to score points and turns will alternate between player and computer. Player will always go first. The player and computer both have an accuracy value (between 0-1) associated with them and each round the accuracy value of both players will be tested against a random number between 0 and 1. If the accuracy value is higher, the player can select where the dart will be thrown on the board. If it is lower, the dart will be thrown randomly on the board and the same goes for the computer. At the end of the 5 rounds, the points will be added up and whoever has the most points will be deemed the winner.
