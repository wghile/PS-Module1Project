# Overview

This project is my first game built while enrolled in the Per Scholas Software Engineering course. Players will go against the computer to see who can score the most points in a classic game of darts.

# Game Play

There are 5 rounds for the player and CPU to score points and turns alternate between player and CPU. Player always go first. The player and CPU both have an accuracy value (between 0-1) associated with them and each round the accuracy value of both players will be tested against a random number between 0 and 1. If the accuracy value is higher, the player can select where the dart will be thrown on the board. If it is lower, the dart will be thrown randomly on the board and the same goes for the computer. At the end of the 5 rounds, the points will be added up and whoever has the most points will be deemed the winner. Goodluck!
